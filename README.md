# Info2 Projects
This is a repo for all of my Info2 Project code for the Semester SS25
## GameServer
This is a simple game server that allows you to play games against other players or against an AI.
[Here](./GameServer/README.md) is the documentation for the project.
## MCT_checkers
This Project implements the Monte Carlo Search Tree algorithm for the game "checkers".
[Here](./MCTS_checkers/README.md) is the documentation for the project.
## pvp_checkers
This is an outdated version. Originally created because i was bored in info1, it only supports player-vs-player.
